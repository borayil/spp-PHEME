# Longitudinal Analysis of Network Data   

Python code for the short programming project course at the University of Groningen by Bora Yilmaz, under the supervision of Mirela Riveni. Libraries used are


This code is used to read, prepare and perform longitudinal analysis, extract key insight values and create Ego graphs on the [PHEME Rumour Dataset](https://www.pheme.eu/2016/06/13/pheme-rumour-dataset-support-certainty-and-evidentiality/). Sections are not refactored optimally, but still each part of the code is commented and straight to the point. Sections are clearly seperated from each other via comments.

In order to run the code and create all of the output (figures and terminal output), run the script by the following command  
`python3 longitudinal.py`

The output of each event has it's seperate folder and is saved in the respective `output/event` folder. The process of the script, along with key values are printed out in the terminal.
